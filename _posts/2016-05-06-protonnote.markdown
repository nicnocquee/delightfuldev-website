ProtonNote is a Mac app to store code snippets and programming notes powered by Github's [Gist](https://gist.github.com). With the clean design, you will enjoy writing and reading your own notes or the gists that you forked. The categories on the sidebar also makes it easy to browse through your gists by grouping your gists based on the programming language. It is great not only for saving code snippets, but also for jotting down your thoughts and ideas by allowing you to add images to a gist and the multiple drafts feature. Check out the demo below.
