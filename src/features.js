    body: "The iOS apps we make do not only follow Apple's user interface guidelines; we also follow the design trends in high quality apps in the App Store. But a high quality app is not only about a good looking user interface. It is, more importantly, about a great user experience. If it takes three taps or more to do something that a user does frequently, there's something wrong with the app's usability. And we understand that."
